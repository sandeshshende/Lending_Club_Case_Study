## General Information

### Project Information
This project leverages the Lending Club dataset to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.

### Project Background
Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, providing personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. The platform allows borrowers to access loans at lower interest rates quickly and conveniently. However, similar to other lending institutions, the primary source of financial loss, known as credit loss, stems from lending to "risky" applicants. Credit loss refers to the amount lost by lenders when borrowers fail to repay their loans. In this context, customers labeled as "charged-off" are identified as defaulters.

### Project Statement
The goal of this project is to identify the key factors contributing to loan defaults, which represent a significant financial risk for the company.

### Data Set
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing loan data from Lending Club.

## Conclusions
### Major Driving Factors for Predicting Loan Defaults
The following factors can be instrumental in predicting loan defaults and minimizing credit loss:

- Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio
- Loan Grades
- Verification Status
- Annual Income
- Public Record of Bankruptcies

### Additional Considerations for Defaults:
- Borrowers from major urban areas such as California, New York, Texas, and Florida.
- Borrowers with annual incomes ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.
- Borrowers with a history of public recorded bankruptcy.
- Borrowers with low grades (E, F, G), indicating higher risk.
- Borrowers with high Debt-to-Income ratios.
- Borrowers with over ten years of work experience.
